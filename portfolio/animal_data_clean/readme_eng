ENG Animal Observation Data Cleaning (Python)

Project Goal

The goal of this project was to clean and standardize a CSV file containing animal observation data.
It demonstrates hands-on data cleaning, validation, and preprocessing techniques to prepare messy data for analysis.

Data Cleaning Process

Imported and explored the dataset using Pandas
Removed unnecessary columns and duplicate records
Corrected typos and inconsistent names (e.g., “red squirel” → “Red Squirrel”)
Standardized text formats and data types
Filled missing values (e.g., Gender = “unknown”)
Rounded numeric and coordinate values
Converted various date formats (e.g., 03.01.2024, 7 May 2024) to datetime
Exported the cleaned dataset to clean_data_animal.csv

Skills Demonstrated

Python & Pandas – data wrangling and cleaning workflows
Data Cleaning – fixing errors, normalizing names, handling missing data
Data Validation – consistent typing and format conversion
Data Quality Analysis – duplicate and outlier detection
Attention to Detail – producing a clean, analysis-ready dataset

Outcome

A consistent and high-quality animal observation dataset, ready for further exploration and visualization in BI tools.
