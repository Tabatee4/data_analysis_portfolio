ENG Coffee Shop Sales Data Cleaning (Python)

Project Goal

The goal of this project was to clean and prepare a raw CSV file with coffee shop transactions for further business analysis.
It demonstrates practical data cleaning, validation, and preprocessing skills.

Data Cleaning Process

Imported and explored the raw dataset using Pandas
Handled missing values, invalid entries, and incorrect data types
Replaced errors with NaN and standardized formats
Removed duplicates and detected potential outliers
Filled missing values using computed temporary columns
Saved the cleaned dataset as a new CSV file ready for analysis

Skills Demonstrated

Python & Pandas – data loading, manipulation, and type conversion
Data Cleaning – handling missing data, duplicates, and outliers
Data Validation – ensuring consistency and numeric accuracy (e.g., Total Spent)
Problem Solving – identifying and resolving real-world data issues
Portfolio-Ready Preparation – dataset ready for dashboards and reports

Outcome

A clean, consistent, and analysis-ready dataset enabling sales reports by product, payment method, and location.
