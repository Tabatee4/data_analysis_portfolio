Restaurant Data Cleaning (Python)

Project Goal

The goal of the project was to clean a raw CSV file containing restaurant transaction data.
The task aimed to demonstrate the ability to identify missing values, perform logical validation of data, and prepare it for further analysis or visualization.

Data Cleaning Process

Loaded and explored the dataset (size, data types, missing values)
Filled missing item names (Item) and payment methods (Payment Method)
Calculated missing values based on relationships between columns
Filled in missing data where possible
Removed rows without complete numeric information
Converted columns to proper data types
Verified consistency of calculations
Saved the cleaned dataset as a .csv file
Skills Demonstrated in the Project

Python & Pandas – data processing and validation

Data Cleaning – filling missing values, type conversions, fixing inconsistencies
Data Validation – verifying relationships between columns and logical checks
Problem Solving – resolving typical issues in transactional data
Data Preparation – creating clean datasets ready for further analysis in Excel, Power BI, or SQL

Result

A clean and consistent restaurant dataset was created, containing complete order information and ready for sales, trend, and payment method analysis.
