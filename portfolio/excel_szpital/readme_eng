Hospital Data Analysis (Excel)

Project Goal

The goal of this project was to analyze synthetic hospital data to understand department occupancy, patient satisfaction, and relationships between stay length, age, and type of service.
All data were created for educational and analytical practice purposes only.

Analysis Summary

Total patients: 1000, staff: 110 (approx. 9.1 patients per staff member)
Average stay length: 7.4 days; average patient age: 45.3 years
Most admissions in Emergency (263), least in ICU (241)
Youngest and oldest patients most often used Surgery and Emergency units
Highest satisfaction in ICU (81.62), lowest in Emergency (77.88)
Slight satisfaction increase for stays longer than 5 days
Bed occupancy ranged from 87.72% (September) to 96.94% (October)
