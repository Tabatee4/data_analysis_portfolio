Project overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow for a streaming platform — from data extraction and processing in SQL and Python to building an interactive Power BI dashboard.
The goal was to showcase skills in working with large datasets, performing SQL analytics, and transforming data into a professional business report.

Project stages

1. Data preparation and analysis (Python + SQL)

Connected to PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.
Wrote SQL queries to analyze:
user activity and engagement,
most popular movies and genres,
average watch time by device and plan,
monthly revenue and user demographics.
Exported query results to .csv files for Power BI visualization.
Conducted data validation and quick exploratory plots in Matplotlib.

Skills demonstrated:

SQL (aggregations, window functions, CASE, CTE)
Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib)
Data preparation and ETL for BI tools

2. Visualization and reporting (Power BI)

Built a two-page report titled Netflix Report (Aug 2022 – Jul 2025).

Page 1 – User & Platform Overview:
Active vs inactive users
User distribution by country and subscription plan
Top 10 users by watch time
Device usage
Downloaded vs streamed content share

Page 2 – Financial & Content Insights:

Total subscription revenue
Most watched genre
Average user age
Top 3 movies and top 3 productions by budget
Monthly revenue trend visualization

Skills demonstrated:

Power BI (data modeling, DAX, interactivity)
Dashboard design and storytelling
Data integration from SQL + CSV sources

Outcome

A complete analytical workflow — from SQL data extraction to a fully interactive Power BI dashboard — offering clear insights into Netflix’s user behavior, revenue patterns, and content popularity.
